			SILGRAPHITE COMPILER

The SIL Graphite compiler builds a Graphite enabled font from a smart font
description, written in GDL (Graphite Description Language) and a TrueType
font by adding extra TrueType tables to it which the Graphite engine can 
interpret.

INSTALL

UNIX style systems:

The grcompiler project uses GNU autobuild tools to manage building and 
installation, please see the INSTALL file for more details.

Win32 based systems:

to build release binaries:

    nmake -f makefile.mak
    
to build debug binaries:

    nmake CFG=DEBUG -f makefile.mak
    
In each case two executabales are built:
    gdlpp	- The GDL preprocessor
    grcompiler	- The GDL to smart font compiler.

Cleaning up, to remove all .obj files without removing the binaries:

    nmake -f makefile.mak clean

To remove the binaries as well:

    nmake -f makefile.mak realclean

this deletes the libraries as well.


ICU

The Graphite compiler requires library modules from ICU. We are currently
using version 3.6. You will need to download the ICU source code from the
following web site:

    http://www.icu-project.org/download/
    
There is a VisualStudio file in the source\allinone directory that can be
used to build the binaries. The "common" project is the one to build.

The only modules that are needed at this time are icuuc.lib and icuuc36.dll
(icuucd.lib and icuuc36d.dll for the debug version). The .lib files
are apparently stubs that call the DLLs. The following source header
files are needed as well:

- uchar.h (#included in main.h)
- pwin32.h
- uconfig.h
- umachine.h
- urename.h
- utf8.h
- utf16.h
- utf.h
- utf_old.h
- utypes.h
- uversion.h
