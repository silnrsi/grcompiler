 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE 
 ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S 
 ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 .
 1. DEFINITIONS
 .
 "Contribution" means:
 .
      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed 
 under this Agreement, and 
 .
      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
 .
      i) changes to the Program, and 
 .
      ii) additions to the Program; 
 .
      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by 
 that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to 
 the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. 
 Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of 
 software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and 
 (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. 
 .
 .
 "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
 .
 "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily 
 infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
 .
 "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
 .
 "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all 
 Contributors.
 .
 .
 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 .
      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a 
 non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works 
 of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such 
 Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. 
 .
      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a 
 non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, 
 sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if 
 any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of 
 the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, 
 such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed 
 Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the 
 Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. 
 .
      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its 
 Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program 
 does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each 
 Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based 
 on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the 
 rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to 
 secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party 
 patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's 
 responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. 
 .
      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights 
 in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 
 .
 .
 3. REQUIREMENTS
 .
 A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license 
 agreement, provided that:
 .
      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and 
 .
      b) its license agreement: 
 .
      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, 
 express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and 
 implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 
 .
      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, 
 including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost 
 profits; 
 .
      iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that 
 Contributor alone and not by any other party; and 
 .
      iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and 
 informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily 
 used for software exchange. 
 .
 When the Program is made available in source code form:
 .
      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
 .
      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 
 .
 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
 .
 Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a 
 manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the 
 Contribution.
 .
 .
 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 .
 Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end 
 users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the 
 commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product 
 offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other 
 Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product 
 offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify 
 every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs 
 (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a 
 third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions 
 of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a 
 commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or 
 Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to 
 qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in 
 writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with 
 the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The 
 Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
 .
 For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product 
 X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes 
 performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and 
 warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the 
 Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to 
 those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay 
 any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
 .
 .
 5. NO WARRANTY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, 
 WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
 LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS 
 FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the 
 appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its 
 exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of 
 program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or 
 equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
 .
 .
 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL 
 HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
 DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
 LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) 
 ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS 
 GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 .
 7. GENERAL
 .
 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall 
 not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and 
 without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum 
 extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent 
 applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent 
 licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as 
 of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation 
 against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the 
 Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) 
 infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) 
 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
 All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of 
 the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a 
 reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights 
 under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program 
 as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and 
 any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid 
 inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. 
 The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this 
 Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify 
 this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to 
 serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement 
 will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always 
 be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In 
 addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to 
 distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly 
 stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the 
 intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by 
 implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this 
 Agreement are reserved.
 .
 This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property 
 laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action 
 under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its 
 rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
