			SILGRAPHITE COMPILER

The SIL Graphite compiler builds a Graphite enabled font from a smart font
description, written in GDL (Graphite Description Language) and a TrueType
font by adding extra TrueType tables to it which the Graphite engine can 
interpret.

INSTALL

UNIX style systems:

The grcompiler project uses GNU autobuild tools to manage building and 
installation, please see the INSTALL file for more details.

Win32 based systems:

to build release binaries:

    nmake -f makefile.mak
    
to build debug binaries:

    nmake CFG=DEBUG -f makefile.mak
    
In each case two executabales are built:
    gdlpp	- The GDL preprocessor
    grcompiler	- The GDL to smart font compiler.

Cleaning up, to remove all .obj files without removing the binaries:

    nmake -f makefile.mak clean

To remove the binaries as well:

    nmake -f makefile.mak realclean

this deletes the libraries as well.
