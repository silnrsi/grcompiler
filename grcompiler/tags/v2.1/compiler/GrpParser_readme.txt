The grammar and syntax of the Graphite Description Language are defined in the GrpParser.g file. This file is compiled using the ANTLR package, which generates the following files:

GrpLexer.cpp
GrpLexer.hpp
GrpParser.cpp
GrpParser.hpp
GrpParserTokenTypes.hpp
GrpParserTokenTypes.txt

Please do not attempt to modify these files by hand! They should only be generated by ANTLR.

In order to run ANTLR, you will need the ANTLR package (implemented using Java) and also Java must be installed on your machine. Please contact Sharon Correll (sharon_correll@sil.org) for more information.
