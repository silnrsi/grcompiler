 * We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
 * we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
 * ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
 * incorporate any source code into one of your programs
 * (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
 * you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
 * research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
 * developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
 * you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
 * headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
 * guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
 * system and expect to make other tools available as they are
 * completed.
