 * ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.
 * <p>
 * We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
 * we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
 * ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
 * incorporate any source code into one of your programs
 * (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
 * you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
 * research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
 * developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
 * you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
 * headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
 * guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
 * system and expect to make other tools available as they are
 * completed.

/**A Stream of characters fed to the lexer from a InputStream that can
 * be rewound via mark()/rewind() methods.
 * <p>
 * A dynamic array is used to buffer up all the input characters.  Normally,
 * "k" characters are stored in the buffer.  More characters may be stored during
 * guess mode (testing syntactic predicate), or when LT(i>k) is referenced.
 * Consumption of characters is deferred.  In other words, reading the next
 * character is not done by conume(), but deferred until needed by LA or LT.
