Description: Compiler of smart (graphite) fonts
 SILGraphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart
 fonts" capable of displaying writing systems with various complex
 behaviors, such as: contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split
 glyphs, bidirectionality, stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a
 complement to other smart font rendering technologies with limited
 practical local extensability. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of
 a very large number of "minority language" communities for local
 extensibility of complex script behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the SILGraphite rendering engine for a given writing
 system is specified through extra tables added to a TrueType font. These
 tables are generated by compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language)
 source file into a font using grcompiler.
 .
 This package contains the graphite compiler.
