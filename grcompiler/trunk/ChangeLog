This is the changelog for the SIL Graphite Compiler project

17 Sept 2013  Sharon Correll
    More changes for version 4.3.1:
    * Handle bidi bracket codes and defaults
    * Remove gpoint and x/yoffset glyph attributes 
        unless command line switch -offsets is turned on.
    * Don't output space contextual flags, since they break the font
        for early versions of Graphite1 engine.
        
7 May 2013  Sharon Correll
	Version 4.3.1
    * Pass-key-slot optimizations (Graphite2 engine only)

10 May 2012  Sharon Correll
	More changes for version 4.2:

	* Changed -d option to -D, -d option now generates XML file only.
	* Output decimal numbers for glyph IDs in debugger files.

19 Apr 2012  Daniel Glassey
	Version 4.2
	Changes since 4.1:
	* Handle a large number of glyphs in replacement classes; 
		this will produce Silf table v 4.0.
	* Ensure that requesting the metrics of a pseudo-glyph will 
		return the metrics of the corresponding actual glyph.
	* Error messages and debugger files use decimal for glyph IDs.
	* Add the segsplit slot attribute, to be used by the Graphite2 
		engine for caching optimization.
	* Added a line-break flag to permit optimization in Graphite2.
	* Fixed problems with Macintosh strings in the name table.
